> **AI-powered data analytics and visualization platform** for turning raw spreadsheets into actionable, explainable insights.

Data Whisperer Pro is a modern analytics experience that helps teams upload datasets, profile data quality, generate charts, surface risks, and ask natural-language questions about their data. It combines a polished React interface with AI-assisted analysis, making it easier to move from CSV to decision-ready insight in minutes.

## Overview

This project is designed for analysts, developers, and business users who need a fast way to understand the shape, quality, and story of a dataset. The platform focuses on:

- Automated profiling and trust scoring
- Visual exploration of numeric and categorical data
- Explainable AI-generated narratives and recommendations
- A clean workflow for future FastAPI + MySQL integration

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Smart file upload | Import `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` datasets quickly. |
| Dataset profiling | Detect missing values, duplicates, outliers, distributions, and data types. |
| Trust & risk scoring | Generate a quality score with breakdowns, contradictions, and warning signals. |
| Auto-generated charts | Create visualizations automatically from dataset structure. |
| AI insights | Produce business, student, or developer-focused narratives and recommendations. |
| Ask-your-data chat | Query the dataset in natural language with context-aware responses. |
| PDF reporting | Export analysis results into a shareable report. |
| Responsive dashboard | Use the platform on desktop and mobile with a polished, modern UI. |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ or Bun
- Python 3.10+
- MySQL 8+
- API key for Gemini or OpenAI

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-whisperer-pro.git
cd data-whisperer-pro
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

If you prefer npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file and add the required values:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
LOVABLE_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/data_whisperer_pro
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
bun run dev
```

or:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Start the backend

If you are running the FastAPI service separately:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Upload a dataset in CSV or Excel format.
3. Review the dashboard, profiling metrics, and trust score.
4. Explore auto-generated charts and risk flags.
5. Ask questions using the AI chat panel.
6. Export a report when you need a shareable summary.

### Example workflow

```text
Upload file -> Profile data -> Review charts -> Inspect risks -> Ask questions -> Export report
```

## API Integration

Data Whisperer Pro is built to integrate with a FastAPI backend and AI providers for structured data analysis.

### Recommended backend endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/upload` | Receive and validate uploaded datasets. |
| `POST` | `/api/profile` | Return profiling statistics and trust metrics. |
| `POST` | `/api/charts` | Generate chart-ready aggregations and metadata. |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | Handle natural-language questions about the dataset. |
| `GET` | `/api/report/:id` | Retrieve a saved report or export payload. |

### AI provider flow

  U[User Uploads Dataset] --> F[Frontend React App]
  F --> B[FastAPI Backend]
  B --> P[Pandas / NumPy Profiling]
  B --> A[Gemini or OpenAI API]
  B --> D[(MySQL)]
  B --> V[Matplotlib / Plotly Output]
  V --> F
  A --> F
```

### Example request payload

```json
{
  "fileName": "sales_data.csv",
  "persona": "business",
  "mode": "insights",
  "profile": {
    "rowCount": 1250,
    "colCount": 18,
    "missingPct": 4.8
  }
}
```

### Frontend integration notes

- The current React app includes an AI server function for dataset Q&A.
- Replace or proxy that layer with your FastAPI service when you move to a dedicated backend.
- Store provider keys securely in environment variables and never commit them to the repository.

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-user authentication and role-based access control
- Saved workspaces and dataset history
- Scheduled reporting and alerts
- Advanced anomaly detection and forecasting
- More chart templates and custom dashboard layouts
- CSV, Excel, and database connector expansion
- Model comparison workflows for Gemini and OpenAI
- Team collaboration and shared comments on insights
